### BGameSave ??
- Save entities
- Load entities
- This is going to be complicated, not sure what the best way to do this is. Json? but then wont all entities need json constructors? Does that make it less user friendly to other developers using the engine?

- Work more on the game and get it to a playable state
- Using the example game, test to see what needs to be fixed, implemented or improved
